The Socratic Method is used by the FlatIron School's technical experts to assist students as they complete the program. Before starting the program, I was somewhat unfamiliar with this approach to learning. For those who are as unfamiliar as I was, here is what Wikipedia has to say: 

*"The Socratic method, also known as maieutics, method of elenchus, elenctic method, or Socratic debate, is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presumptions. It is a dialectical method, often involving a discussion in which the defense of one point of view is questioned; one participant may lead another to contradict themselves in some way, thus weakening the defender's point. This method is named after the Classical Greek philosopher Socrates and is introduced by him in Plato's Theaetetus as midwifery (maieutics) because it is employed to bring out definitions implicit in the interlocutors' beliefs, or to help them further their understanding.

*The Socratic method is a method of hypothesis elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs. The basic form is a series of questions formulated as tests of logic and fact intended to help a person or group discover their beliefs about some topic, exploring definitions or logoi (singular logos) and seeking to characterize general characteristics shared by various particular instances."*

As I understood it before, and as I understand it today, the Socratic Method is primarily used to disect hypotheses of concepts that seem to lack a concrete definition (e.g., philosophical topics like morality, existance, etc.). My understanding of coding before, and as I understand it today, is black and white: either the code is correct or it is incorrect. While there are many potential solutions to solve a problem in coding, the fundamentals of each coding language abide by a concrete system of rules specific to that language. This is also the case among spoken languages (and signed languages, too): either what the speaker has said has correct grammar, syntax, etc. and can be understood by the listener, or it does not. 

So, why then would the FlatIron School choose a teaching method originally designed and intented to debate morality and defend theories using myths, later adapted by psychotherapists to clarify meaning and feelings, and commonly used in law schools (which, by the way, has its own controversies)? Don't get me wrong, I openly accepted and even blogged about how I am starting this program with absolutely no knowledge or expertise...with an "empty cup" if you will, expecting the FlatIron School to fill the cup with everything I needed. However, I did not expect that when I asked a question seeking guidnace regarding a poorly written code by a inexperienced novice, to be challenged by those tasked with teaching and helping me and need to "defend" my code (which I hardly support to begin with since I acknowledge that it is poorly written due to my lack of understanding).

Regardless, I will push forward to overcome these challenges and strive to gain understanding. I only hope I can maintain composure as I do so...
