Hi there! Joshua, again. Wow! Github is so cool!! It's funny to consider how many labs I've completed and pushed to Github through the Flatiron Learn IDE without really understanding everything that was involved in the process! I also feel a kind of rejuvinated vigor after completed this curriculum section. It's so exciting to be reminded of collaboration and how coders help make life easier for everyone in the field. 

I can't imagine what the field was like prior to the creation of Github and other repositories. I feel so fortunate to be learning how to code in this decade! It's so accessible and supportive. There are so many ways to find information and gain more understanding about whatever I have questions. 

However, this too does not come without it's own challenges. For years, I have been a text-book learner. In high school, college, and subsequent educational programs, I have always relied on condensed information sources through which I can read, take notes, and memorize/apply whatever I needed to pass a course. Now, I am tasked with learning new ways to learn and compiling my own resources to serve as a surrogate text-book. Again, I am excited to work through this new challenge and am exiting to have a large virtual library of resources (from Github to Pocket) on which I can rely to help me succeed! 

While this section of the curriculum has proven to be a nice "break" from coding with Ruby, I am looking forward the upcoming HTML/CSS sections and the subsequent Procedural and Object Oriented Ruby modules.
