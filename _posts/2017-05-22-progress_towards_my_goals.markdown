title:  Progress towards my goals

It is with great excitement that I can announce: I've made much progress towards my personal goals! 

No longer does seeing an error message incite my inner critic to claim I have failed or compare me to others. 

No longer do I stress over mistakes or have the expectation that my code should be "perfect" when I sit down to write. 

I still have a long way to go towards the ultimate goals I have set for myself, but I felt it appropriate to celebrate what I have achieved so far. 

HTML(5) has been fun, but rather boring. It is so straight-forward (at least from my first exposure) that I miss the challenges that Ruby presented. I am eager to continue my lessons: I've heard many opinions about Ruby on Rails and it has intrigued me. Hopefully, I will have made further progress towards my personal goals so that I am prepared for what that has in store for me...
