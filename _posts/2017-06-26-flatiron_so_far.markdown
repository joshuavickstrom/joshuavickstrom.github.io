Only Object Oriented Ruby left before my first set of projects! I couldn't be more excited to have reached this point in the program. I'm still unsure if I am progressing fast enough to be on track for graduation when I originally had planned, but only time will tell how things will end up. 

I am hoping that if the introduction to OO was any indicator, I will breeze through these lessons and be able to tackle the projects with gusto. 

It would be a vilation of my character if I didn't acknowledge that without certain Technical Coaches, I wouldn't be as far, for feel as strong in my coding abilities, as I do. A tip of the hat to those two.  ðŸ¤—
