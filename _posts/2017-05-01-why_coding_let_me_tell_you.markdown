**Long story short: **

I've been a mental health professional for seven years. After spending most of my young-adult years investing in the future of others at the expense of my own happiness, I began to search for a way out. 

I spent months researching various options:
* *Pursue higher education? No - it would delay the timeline I created for myself and potentially lead to much student-loan debt
 Pursue a new career starting at an entry level position? No - surprisingly, being an expert in human behavior with a strong clinical reputation doesn't give a person a lot of appeal with applying to jobs
 Pursue a second bachelor's degree? Maybe - if I could find a cheap, expedited, program it could work*

It was during my research for a second bachelor's degree in computer science that led me to the idea of a "coding bootcamp" and in a few short hours, I discovered the #amazing FlatIron School and jumped into Javascript. 

The rest is history and the future is filled with possibilities thanks to **#coding <3**
