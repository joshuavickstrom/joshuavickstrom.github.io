Hello! Welcome to my blog! My name is Joshua and I am by no means a “blogger.” However, I am open to new experiences and will put all my heart into blogging during my time with the Flatiron School. 

As with all narratives, it is best to start at the beginning. To keep things short, I’ll start during my sophomore year of college: As a psychology major at the University of Mary Washington, I felt a desire to apply what I was learning and searched for entry level jobs within the field of psychology. After some research, I came upon an offering that would allow me to work 1:1 with individuals of various age ranges with different mental disorders. I jumped at the opportunity to escape waiting tables and quickly found how much I loved the challenge this work offered, as well as how rewarding it made me feel. I pursued higher education, received national certification, and became licensed in the state of Virginia. I truly felt I had found the career for me.

Fast forward to 2017, and you would find an overworked, underpaid, exhausted me. With recent changes to the healthcare system in America, I found my rates were being cut every year, which caused me to work longer hours and more days each week. The company who employed me offered no solutions either and upon further investigation, I realized that no company was different and that the trends in this field reminded me of a crashing plane. It was with great despair that I concluded I needed to completely switch fields and start a new career path. One that would ensure opportunities for growth, both professionally and financially, as well as offer the same level of challenge and require the same level of continued education, as these qualities are important for me to feel engaged with anything I do.

After months of researching options, I stumbled upon coding boot camps and spent time working through the Flatiron School’s free coding modules. Suddenly, a spark of interest grew into a flame of hope: I had found what I had been searching for; I had found a way out! 

So, here I am: a 28-year-old starting over. I retired from my career in the mental health field, said my farewells to families and clients I had known for half a decade, and set off to master coding.
