Hello again! Joshua here, and I am so eager to share some great news: I finished coding my first Tic Tac Toe game! I really enjoyed the mini-coding challenges sprinkled throughout the curriculum that built up to this final introductory coding project! Sure, just like any American kid, I grew up playing Tic Tac Toe at school or with my sister. I even learned the special “strategic” moves that would guarantee a win! So, being able to code something so nostalgic to me was exciting and a great learning platform. 

For the most part, because of the previous coding exercises, this lab wasn’t as intimidating. Nevertheless, I took the time to write out my pseudo-code to prepare for what was to come. Reading through the lab’s README.md, I was confident when starting to code. Using the pseudo-code, I started defining the methods and making notes of which code the methods would require. The easiest methods included the initialize, the win combinations, display board, and input to index. 

However, I ran into some challenges coding the turn method and it’s required helper methods. It took some time, but with online research and revisiting older labs, I found the cleanest way to write the necessary Booleans and the Ruby methods I needed to succeed (e.g., .between?, .detect, ,any?). The most useful information I found was on the [Ruby operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_operators.htm). These might be a personal favorite of mine. 

My greatest disappoint though, is learning that it wouldn’t be easy to share the code with a friend so that we could play a game together! Maybe a future lab will remedy this!
