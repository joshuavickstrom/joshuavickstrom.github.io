I'm super proud of myself as I wake up today. Sure, this blog post is techinically "late", but I'm ignoring that fact. 

Today marks the one week anniversy for starting the FlatIron program. I chose to leave the career I've spent nearly all of my adult life doing, but I feel empowered and happy for the first time in a long time. 

My personal goals to achieve by the end of this program:
1. Don't let my simple mistakes frustrate me
2. Learn from everyone and every source I possibly can
3. Enjoy every moment of this process 

Number 1 is deffently the hardest for me, right now. I've always considered myself detail-oriented, but I acknowledge that when I make simple mistakes (like using quotes instead of backtics) it invokes feelings of self-doubt and my inner critic reminds me that "I should have known better" or "Other people don't make these mistakes". It will take some time, maybe even the full length of the program, to conquer this goal. Yet, I feel change occuring within myself already. I feel so fornutate to be in a program that promotes kindess and is so supportive.
